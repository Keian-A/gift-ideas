# Gift Ideas

An application I am making primarily for my own family. Open source.

I came accross the problem where we were just using a Google sheets application in order to add gifts that we wanted. Family members would look at this sheet and cross out the gift we were getting for someone.

Problems that arose:
- When you cross out a gift, the person would see what they are getting when they add something next.
- When you delete a gift you are purchasing, the person who wanted that gift might re-add it because they didn't know it was bought.
