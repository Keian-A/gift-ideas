# Gift Ideas

User Experience:
- Needs to check user on load, save to state after checking with back-end to see if valid login.
- Once logged in, get req to back-end to get all lists from db.
- Render a list displaying what everyone has (and crosses out what other people have crossed out except the person logged in)
- Created Login component to validate user before asking for the list.
- Validates user on back-end still and then grab full list and send to front-end.
- Have an option to add an item to your own list, or remove an item on the list.

List needs-to-have:
- Don't delete, archive gifts instead. Potentially add a "re-buy" option.
- Add Calendar with option to delete gifts after holiday or birthday.
- Personal button to remove all purchased items from your list.
