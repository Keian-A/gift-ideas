# Gift Ideas

User Experience:
- Needs to check user on load, save to state after checking with back-end to see if valid login.
- Once logged in, get req to back-end to get all lists from db.
- Render a list displaying what everyone has (and crosses out what other people have crossed out except the person logged in)

List needs-to-have:
- Have an option to add an item to your own list, or remove an item on the list

- Created Login component to validate user before asking for the list. Need to validate user on back-end still and then grab full list and send to front-end.
